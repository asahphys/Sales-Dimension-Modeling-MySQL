This project demonstrates an end-to-end sales analytics workflow using MySQL and Tableau. A transactional relational database was redesigned using a snowflake schema data model in MySQL to improve analytical performance and support efficient querying for business analysis.

The analysis focuses on order details, customer information, product data, and brand and category revenue contributions. Using MySQL for data preparation and Tableau for visualization, this project highlights revenue distribution patterns and provides insights into sales performance across different product segments.
